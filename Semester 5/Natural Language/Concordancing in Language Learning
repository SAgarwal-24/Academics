Collocations
Lexicographers and linguists (although rarely those of a generative bent)
COLLOCATION have long been interested in collocations. 

A collocation is any turn of
phrase or accepted usage where somehow the whole is perceived to have
an existence beyond the sum of the parts. 

Collocations include compounds
(disk drive), phrasal verbs (make up), and other stock phrases
(bacon and eggs). 

They often have a specialized meaning or are idiomatic,
but they need not be. For example, at the time of writing, a favorite expression
of bureaucrats in Australia is international best practice. 

Now
there appears to be nothing idiomatic about this expression; it is simply
two adjectives modifying a noun in a productive and semantically compositional
way. But, nevertheless, the frequent use of this phrase as a
fixed expression accompanied by certain connotations justifies regarding
it as a collocation. Indeed, any expression that people repeat because
they have heard others using it is a candidate for a collocation.
v Collocations are discussed in detail in chapter 5. We see later on that
collocations are important in areas of Statistical NLP such as machine
translation (chapter 13) and information retrieval (chapter 15). In machine
translation, a word may be translated differently according to the
collocation it occurs in. An information retrieval system may want to
index only ‘interesting’ phrases, that is, those that are collocations.
Lexicographers are also interested in collocations both because they
show frequent ways in which a word is used, and because they are multiword
units which have an independent existence and probably should
appear in a dictionary. They also have theoretical interest: to the extent
that most of language use is people reusing phrases and constructions
